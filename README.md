<b> 1. Data analytics maturity in an organization </b>

Data analytics is becoming increasingly important for organizations looking to gain insights from their past and present data to make better business decisions. The main objective of data analytics is to answer three key questions: why a particular phenomenon is happening, what will happen next, and how to utilize that knowledge best.
For example, a company may use data analytics to identify its most profitable customers and understand why some customers are less profitable. They can then use this information to segment their customer base and make targeted cross-selling and pricing decisions.
According to a report by Deloitte, there are five different levels of analytics maturity that organizations can fall into based on their approach to data analytics. These include:
1.	Analytically impaired organizations, which have little or no data infrastructure and have poorly defined data-driven strategies.
2.	Localized Analytics organizations, which are adopting analytics in silos.
3.	Aspirational Analytics organizations, which have expanded ad-hoc analytical capacities beyond silos and into mainstream business decisions.
4.	Analytics organizations, which capitalize on the rise of data utilization by industrializing analytics to aggregate and combine data into meaningful content and new ideas.
5.	Insight-driven organizations, which automate transforming analytics into decision-making across all business functions.
In today's world, data is said to be the new oil, and organizations are constantly striving to extract insights from data to drive business strategies and improve performance. By understanding where they fall on the analytics maturity spectrum, organizations can better understand where they need to focus their efforts to improve their use of data analytics and make better business decisions.
